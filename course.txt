Definition and Meaning of Psychology 
  
Definition and Meaning of Psychology 
	Psychology – comes from the Greek words “Psyche” meaning “mind” and “logia” or “logos” meaning, “the study of something”. 
	Psychology – The scientific study of overt behavior and mental processes (Coon & Mitterer, 2016) 
	Keywords: Science, behaviour, mental processes 
	Psychology helps to explain how we think, feel and act both individually and as a group 
 
Developmental Psychology 
 
 
	This field focuses on human growth and changes across the lifespan, including physical, cognitive, social,     intellectual, perceptual, personality and emotional growth (APA, 2020). 
	Psychologists in this field study how people  grow, develop and adapt at different life stages.  
	They conduct research designed to help people reach their full potential 
GOALS OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY 
  
 
1.	Description – This is to describe behaviors. One should be able to describe what transpires across the lifespan of the human organism. 
2.	Explanation – This is to explain behaviour. Why do people do the things they do? What factors contribute to the child’s way of thinking and talking? 
3.	Prediction – To make predictions about how one thinks and act to predict developmental changes.  When prediction is successful, it can help the teacher or psychologist to make guesses 
4.	Change – To help influence and control behaviour to make lasting changes in people’s lives. 
DEVELOPMENT, GROWTH, AND MATURATION EXPLAINED 
	Development is defined as the orderly and progressive changes that do occur according to time as organisms move from conception to death. 
  
	Human development entails growth and maturation. 
	Though, people use the words growth and maturation interchangeably, in Psychology, they are a little different. 
	Growth - It is the physical of development.  
	It is quantifiable,  measurable and influenced by genetics. 
  
	Maturation – It refers to the intellectual or emotional aspect of development. Unlike growth, maturation is often not quantifiable and influenced by genetics but largely by environmental factors. 
	It can be said that it is the qualitative change that occurs in an individual at a particular stage in life for the performance of certain tasks. 
  
Learning 
  
	Learning – Learning is said to occur when a person acquires knowledge or experience. 
	Learning requires environmental influence.  
	Therefore, learning is defined as a relatively permanent change in behavioural potentiality as a result of 
reward/reinforced practice or experience (behaviourists/cognitivists). 
DOMAINS OF DEVELOPMENT 
                           
	Physical Domain: Changes in body size, proportions, appearance, functioning of body systems, perceptual and motor capacities, and physical health. 
	Cognitive Domain: Changes in intellectual abilities, including attention, memory, academic and everyday knowledge, problem solving, imagination, creativity, and language. 
	Socioemotional Domain: Changes in emotional communication, self-understanding, knowledge about other people, interpersonal skills, friendships, intimate relationships, and moral reasoning and behaviour 
PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 
There is a set of principles that characterizes the pattern and process of growth and development. 
	Cephalocaudal Principle – It describes the direction of development and states that development proceeds from top to bottom. 
	Children gain physical control of their head first after which the physical control moves downwards to the arms and to the legs. 
	Normally, newborns need support with head. By 2 months, they develop strength to hold the head and in subsequent months, they gains control over the use of the arms. 
  
	Proximodistal Principle – Also describes the direction of development. 
	This principle states that development proceeds from the center of the body outward. 
	For a fertilized egg, the cell divides and expand outward to become an embryo. 
	Spinal cord forms limbs of the body form before the hands and the feet and the hands and the feet develop before the fingers and toes. 
  
	Orthogenetic Principle – The development of all aspects of functioning (including cognition, perception, etc.) progresses from lack of differentiation to increasing differentiation, articulation, and hierarchic integration (Werner, 1957).    
	For example, children use their cognitive and language skills (simple) to reason and solve problems (complex). 
  
	Development proceeds from general to specific – In every type of development, general activity proceeds specific activity.  
	E.g. infants after birth are able to make general movements with the eyes, arms and legs.  
	After the perfection of these general movements, infants learn to make specific movements. 
	Development is Gradual – Development does not come all of a sudden. It is cumulative in nature. 
	The rate of development varies from person to person – Development rate is not uniform. Boys and girls have different development rates and each part of the body has its own particular rate of growth.  
	There are periods of intensity and equilibrium and there are periods of imbalance 
	Development is predictable – Physiological and psychological potentialities can be predicted by observation and psychological tests. 
	Development is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors – for e.g. poor nutrition can mare the growth of an individual. Reduce intellectual abilities and stature. 
	Most traits are correlated in development – It is known in development that most of the traits are correlated or related.  
	For instance, a child whose mental or cognitive development is above average, is also superior in so many other aspects like health, sociability and special aptitudes. 
A child who has a good health can be active socially and intellectually. This means that there is constant interaction between all the factors of development 
	Growth and development are asynchronous– Asynchronous development refers to an uneven intellectual, physical, and emotional development. 
	This includes intra and inter differences. 
	These include our feet, female breast, male testicles etc. 
	Growth and development are epigenetic– Epigenetic principle states that we develop through an unfolding of our personalities. 
	This means that progress in each stage is determined by successes-or lack of-in previous stages. 
	For example, our hair, our teeth etc. 
EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLES 
	The directions of human development, e.g. simple to complex, general to specific, must be considered in planning activities for the children to assure satisfaction. 
	Taking into consideration the individual variation in growth, the school programmes must be adjusted 
accordingly to suit students variations. 
	Teachers and parents should consider the maturation of the pupils or students so they do not demand of students what is beyond their stage 
 
WEEK 2 - CONCEPTION AND PRENATAL DEVELOPMEN 
t • Male and Female Reproductive Systems Development 
•	Conception 
•	Prenatal Development (germinal, embryonic stage and fetal stage)  • Labour  
•	Threats to prenatal development 
•	Biological threats  
•	Environmental threats 
MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
•	The male reproductive system is a grouping of organs that make up a man’s reproductive and urinary systems . • These organs include the bladder, the seminal vesicle, epididymis, urethra, prostate gland, pubic bone etc 
. • What functions do these organs perform? 
•	Penis - The male organ for sexual intercourse. It is also the medium through which the urethra exits which allows semen and urine to be released. 
•	Testis- The testes are responsible for making testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, and for producing sperm. 
•	Scrotum- The scrotum protects the testes. 
•	Epididymis- It carries and stores sperm cells that are created in the testes 
•	Urethra- It is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside of your body. It also expels (ejaculates) semen during orgasm. 
•	Prostrate gland - The prostate's primary function is to produce the fluid that nourishes and transports sperm (seminal fluid).  
•	Bladder - The bladder stores urine, and contract and flatten to empty urine through the urethra. 
Seminal Vesicle - The seminal vesicles make a sugar-rich fluid (fructose) that provides sperm with a source of energy and helps with the sperms’ ability to move (motility). 
•	Pubic bone – It protect the intestines, bladder, and internal sex organs 
•	Ductus/Vas deferens – It transports mature sperm to the urethra in preparation for ejaculation. 
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
•	Oviduct/Fallopian tube - These small tubes transport ova from the ovaries to the uterus. This is where an egg waits to be fertilized 
. • Ovaries - The female gonads, the ovaries produce ova. When one matures, it is released down into a fallopian tube. 
•	Uterus - This organ holds and nourishes a developing fetus, if an egg was properly fertilized. 
•	Corpus luteum – It make the uterus a healthy place for a fetus to grow. It releases a hormone called progesterone that prepares your uterus for pregnancy. 
•	Endometrium - It prepares the uterus for implantation, and maintenance of pregnancy if implantation occurs, as well as menstruation in the absence of pregnancy. 
•	Myometrium - It plays an active role during childbirth when it contracts rhythmically to force the baby out of the mother's body.  
•	Cervix – It is the door to the female reproductive system. It allows sperm passage into the uterus through the endocervical canal and it produces mucus to facilitate sperm entry 
•	Vagina- This muscular tube receives the penis during intercourse and through it a baby leaves the uterus during childbirth. 
•	Follicles - They secrete hormones which influence stages of the menstrual cycle in women. Each has the potential to release an egg for fertilization 
 CONCEPTION 
•	Females of reproductive age (beginning anywhere from 11 to 16 years of age) experience cycles of hormonal activity that repeat at about one-month intervals. 
•	With every cycle, a woman’s body prepares for a potential pregnancy, whether or not that is the woman’s intention.  
•	The term menstruation refers to the periodic shedding of the uterine lining. Many women call the days that they notice vaginal bleeding their “period,” “menstrual” or “cycle”.  
•	The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases. These phases include: 
 ✓The follicular phase (development of the egg)  
✓The ovulatory phase (release of the egg) 
 ✓The luteal phase (hormone levels decrease if the egg does not implant)  
•	Foundation of life starts from conception. 
•	Each month inside a woman’s ovaries, a group of eggs starts to grow in small, fluid-filled sacs called follicles 
. • Eventually, one of the eggs erupts from the follicle (ovulation). It usually happens about 2 weeks before your next period. 
•	After the egg leaves the follicle, the follicle develops into something called the corpus luteum. 	 
•	The corpus luteum releases a hormone that helps thicken the lining of your uterus, getting it ready for the egg. 
•	The egg travels to the Fallopian Tube 
After the egg is released, it moves into the fallopian tube. It stays there for about 24 hours, waiting for a single sperm to fertilize it. 
•	After intercourse, conception occurs when a sperm cell combines with an egg cell to form zygote.  
•	If no sperm is around to fertilize the egg, it moves through the uterus and disintegrates. Your hormone levels go back to normal. 
•	Your body sheds the thick lining of the uterus, and your period starts (menstruation).  
PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	This refers to the period of development between conception till birth. 
•	Usually, it takes 9 months for the baby to fully develop before birth. 
•	Different fields have different stages of characterizing the developmental stage before birth. In medicine, it is divided into three trimesters.  
•	In Psychology, this period is divided into three stages: 
•	The germinal stage (0-2 weeks) 
•	The embryonic stage (3-8 weeks 
) • The fetal stage (9 weeks-birth) 
THE GERMINAL STAGE  
•	If one sperm does make its way into the fallopian tube and burrows into the egg, it fertilizes the egg. The egg changes so that no other sperm can get in. 
•	At the instant of fertilization, your baby's genes and sex are set. If the sperm has a Y chromosome, your baby will be a boy. If it has an X chromosome, the baby will be a girl. 
•	The zygote soon begins to divide rapidly in a process called cleavage, first into two identical cells called blastomeres, which further divide to four cells, then into eight, and so on.  
•	The group of diving cells begins to move along the fallopian tube toward the uterus. About sixty hours after fertilization, approximately sixteen cells have formed and three days after fertilization, the cells enters the uterus. 
•	Implantation, the process in which the blastocyst implants into the uterine wall, occurs approximately six days after conception. 
•	Implantation marks the end of the germinal stage and the beginning of the embryonic stage. 
•	However, if implantation fails, the pregnancy terminates. 
•	On the other hand, if it implants itself in the fallopian tube (oviduct), then ectopic pregnancy results. 
THE EMBRYONIC STAGE 
•	The embryonic stage begins after implantation and lasts until eight weeks after conception. 
•	Soon after implantation, the cells continue to rapidly divide and clusters of cells begin to take on different functions (called differentiation). 
•	A process (gastrulation) leads to the formation of three distinct layers called germ layers: 
•	These three layers are:  
•	The ectoderm (outer layer) , • The mesoderm (middle layer), 
•	The endoderm (inner layer). 
•	As the embryo develops, each germ layer differentiates into different tissues and structures. 
•	The process of differentiation continues with different structures forming simultaneously. 
•	By the end of the embryonic stage, all essential external and internal structures have been formed. The embryo is now referred to as a fetus 
The Fetal Stage 
•	Prenatal development is most dramatic during the fetal stage. 
•	When an embryo becomes a fetus at eight weeks, it is approximately 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) in length from crown to rump and weighs about 3 grams (0.1 ounce). 
•	By the time the fetus is considered full-term at 38 weeks gestation, he or she may be 50 centimeters (20 inches) or 3.3 kilograms (7.3 pounds). 
•	Although all the organ systems were formed during embryonic development, they continue to develop and grow during the fetal stage 
 CRITICAL PERIODS IN PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	This refers to periods when delicate and also important organs and systems in the body are formed. 
•	When the uterine wall is not conducive, there will be abnormalities • The critical periods are first trimester after conception, the 7th month and the 9th month. 
 LABOUR 
•	Labour is the process by which the fetus and the placenta leave the uterus. 
•	Delivery can occur in two ways: 
➢	Through the vagina 
➢	By cesarean section. 
 • Factors contributing to caesarian birth 
 ➢Prolonged labor. 
 ➢Abnormal positioning. 
 ➢Fetal distress. 
 ➢Birth defects. 
 ➢Repeated cesarean births. 
 ➢Chronic health condition. 
STAGES OF LABOUR 
 The first stage begins with the woman's first contractions and continues until she is dilated fully (10 centimeters, or 4 inches), which means the cervix has stretched to prepare for birth. 
 The second stage is the active stage, in which the pregnant woman begins to push downward. It begins with complete dilation of the cervix and ends with the actual birth. 
 The third stage, or placental stage, begins with the birth and ends with the completed delivery of the placenta and afterbirth. 
THREATS TO PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	Threats to prenatal development are things that are likely to cause damage or danger to the developing fetus during pregnancy. 
•	These threats can either have biological underpinnings or from the environment. 
•	Biological threats are caused by abnormalies in a person genetic makeup while environmental threats results from environmental toxins and drugs. 
 BIOLOGICAL THREATS TO PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each human has 46 chromosomes, 23 each from each parent. 
•	Twenty-two (22) of these are called autosomes and the 23rd is the sex chromosome. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, differ between males and females.  Females have XX and males have XY. Autosomes look the same in both males and females. 
 Karyotype: This is where all chromosomes appear in their exact pairs in humans or other organisms from a single cell. 
•	A typical human cell is made up of 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes 44 Biological Threats to Prenatal 
Development 
•	However, some people have abnormal chromosome numbers or structure that results in what is called chromosomal disorders. 
•	Examples of chromosomal disorders include Fragile X syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, super male and super female syndrome, Turner’s syndrome etc. 
•	In Klinefelter syndrome for instance, males have an extra X chromosome in most of their cells instead of the normal XY pattern which results in feminine-like features. 
DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA) 
•	It is an extremely long chain of molecules that contains all the information necessary for the life functions of a cell. 
•	DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique 
To carry out these functions, DNA sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins, which are the complex molecules that do most of the work 19/03/2022 in our bodies. 
  Genes 
 • They are the fundamental unit of heredity; a specific section of DNA that tells a cell how to make a specific protein. Proteins are used by the cell to perform certain functions, to grow, and to survive. 
BIOLOGICAL THREATS TO PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT 
Allele 
•	An allele is a variant form of a gene. 
•	Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome. 
•	Humans are called diploid organisms because they have two alleles at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent. 
•	If the two alleles are the same, the individual is homozygous for that gene. 
•	There are other times that people have abnormal gene form or structure that results in what is called genetic disorders. 
•	Examples of genetic disorders include colour blindness, haemophilia, Rhesus factor incompatibility, single cell disease etc. 
•	In Rh factor incompatibility for example, antibodies from an Rhmother may enter the blood stream of her unborn Rh+ infant, damaging the red blood cells (RBCs). 
Genotype and Phenotype 
•	The genotype is a person’s unique combination of genes or genetic makeup. 
•	Thus, the genotype is a complete set of instructions on how that person’s body synthesizes proteins and thus how that body is supposed to be built and function. 
•	A phenotype is an individual's observable traits, such as height, eye color, and blood type. 
•	Not all the instructions in the genotype may be carried out (or expressed). 
SICKLE CELL DISEASE 
•	It is a genetic condition in which red blood cells are not shaped as they should be. Caused by mutation in a gene on chromosome 11. 
•	Red blood cells look like round discs but in sickle cell disease, they're shaped like sickles, or crescent moons, instead. • These sickle shaped cells get stuck together and block small blood vessels. 
  Sickle Cell Disease Symptoms include: 
•	Anemia: Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you with too few red blood cells. 
•	Episodes of pain: Periodic episodes of pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. 
•	Swelling of hands and feet 
•	A child can only have sickle cell disease if they inherit sickling genes from either parents in an autosomal recessive manner. The main sickling genotypes are AA, AS, SS, CC, AC and SC. 
  ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS 
•	Harmful substances such as drugs or radiation that invade the womb and result in birth defects are called teratogens. 
•	The term teratogen refers to any environmental agent that causes damage during the prenatal period. 
•	Scientists chose this label (from the Greek word “teras” meaning “malformation”) because they first learned about harmful prenatal influences from cases in which babies had been profoundly damaged. 
•	Teratogens are especially damaging in the embryonic stage because it is a critical period in prenatal development. 
•	But the harm done by teratogens is not always simple and straightforward. It depends on the following factors: 
•	Dose: As we discuss particular teratogens, you will see that larger doses over longer time periods usually have more negative effects. 
•	Heredity: The genetic makeup of the mother and the developing organism plays an important role. Some individuals are better able than others to withstand harmful environments. 
•	Other negative influences. The presence of several negative factors at once, such as additional teratogens, poor nutrition, and lack of medical care, can worsen the impact of a single harmful agent. 
•	Age: The effects of teratogens vary with the age of the organism at time of exposure. To understand this last idea, think of the sensitive or critical period concept. 
  EXAMPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS 
•	Prescription and Non-prescription Drugs 
•	Illegal Drugs 
•	Tobacco 
•	Alcohol 
•	Radiation 
•	Environmental Pollution from chemicals (Mercury, Lead, Mercury, Pesticides, Carbon monoxide ) 
•	Maternal Disease (Syphilis, Rubella, STD’s, HIV/AIDs) 
•	Other Maternal Factors 
•	Exercise 
•	Nutrition 
•	Drugs 
•	Poverty  
•	Emotional state 
 ALCOHOL 
l • Exposure to alcohol can result in varied abnormalities in childhood and later years. 
•	A child exposed to alcohol in the womb can either have a condition called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). 
•	It encompasses a range of physical, mental, and behavioral outcomes caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), distinguished by 
 FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME 
slow physical growth 
 	 ii. Facial abnormalities (short eyelid openings; a thin upper lip; a smooth or flattened philtrum)  
i. iii. Brain injury resulting in small head, memory problems, language problems, overactivity, challenged with reasoning, motor coordination, or social skills. 
 
 
WEEK 4 – PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT 
• 	Physical Development in Infancy, Childhood and Adolescence 
	Weight and height increase, reflexes, motor skills, nutrition/malnutrition, play, puberty. • 	Cognitive Development  
	Piaget vs. Vygotsky’s theory of Cognitive development 
•	Intelligence and their types (multiple and emotional intelligence) 
•	Educational implications of the physical development of each stage 
PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT 
•	Infancy spans the first year; toddlerhood spans the second, during which children take their first independent steps, marking a shift to greater autonomy. 
•	Childhood: From 2 to 11 years . The body becomes longer and leaner, motor skills are refined, and children become more self-controlled and self-sufficient. Children learn about the wider world and master new responsibilities that increasingly resemble those they will perform as adults. 
•	Adolescence: From 11 to 18 years . This period initiates the transition to adulthood. Puberty leads to an adult-sized body and sexual maturity. 
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT IN INFANCY 
•	Growth is so rapid, and the consequences of neglect are so severe that gains are closely monitored.  
•	Newborns gain an ounce a day for several months. Birthweight typically doubles by 4 months and triples by a year. E. g. an average 7-pound newborn will be 21 pounds at 12 months. 
•	Physical growth in the second year is slower however by 24 months, most children weigh almost 28 pounds averagely. 
•	Newborns also grow in height—from about 20 inches at birth to about 34 inches at age 2 years. 
•	Each of these numbers is a norm, which is a standard, for a particular population. Genetic diversity can allow for healthy newborns from other continent to be smaller or larger than these norms. • 	Motor skills 
•	It is the learned abilities to move some part of the body, in actions ranging from a large leap to a flicker of the eyelid. 
(The word motor here refers to movement of muscles.) 
•	Motor skills start with the newborn making reflexes 
•	A reflex is an involuntary or automatic, action that your body does in response to something — without you even having to think about it. You don't decide to kick your leg, it just kicks 
•	Reflexes that maintain oxygen supply.  
•	The breathing reflex begins even before the umbilical cord, with its supply of oxygen, is cut. Others are reflexive hiccups and sneezes, as well as thrashing (moving the arms and legs about) to escape something that covers the face. 
•	Reflexes that maintain constant body temperature.  
•	When infants are cold, they cry, shiver, and tuck their legs close to their bodies. When they are hot, they try to push away blankets and then stay still. 
•	Reflexes that manage feeding.  
•	The sucking reflex causes newborns to suck anything that touches their lips—fingers, toes, blankets, and rattles, as well as natural and artificial nipples of various textures and shapes.  
•	In the rooting reflex, babies turn their mouths toward anything that brushes against their cheeks—a reflexive search for a nipple—and start to suck.  
Swallowing also aids feeding, as does crying when the stomach is empty and spitting up when too much is swallowed quickly. 
•	Babinski reflex. When a newborn’s feet are stroked, the toes fan upward. 
•	Stepping reflex. When newborns are held upright, feet touching a flat surface, they move their legs as if to walk. 
•	Swimming reflex. When held horizontally on their stomachs, newborns stretch out their arms and legs. 
•	Palmar grasping reflex. When something touches the palms, newborns grip it tightly. 
•	Moro reflex. When someone bangs on the table they are lying on, newborns fling their arms out and then bring them together on their chests, crying with wide open eyes. 
 
Fine Motor Skills 
•	Physical abilities involving small body movements, especially of the hands and fingers, such as drawing and picking up a coin. (The word fine here means “small.”) 
•	The most valued fine motor skills are finger movements, enabling humans to write, draw, type, tie, and so on. Movements of the tongue, jaw, lips, teeth, and toes are fine movements, too. 
•	Usually, mouth skills precede hand skills by many months 
• 	Gross Motor Skills 
•	Physical abilities involving large body movements, such as walking and jumping. (The word gross here means “big.”) 
•	They in a cephalocaudal (head-down) and proximodistal (center-out) direction. 
•	Supported sitting- 3 moths 
•	Unsupported sitting- 6 months 
•	Crawling- 8 to 10 months 
Standing and walking- 1 year and above 
• 	Nutrition and Malnutrition 
•	Nutrition is the sum of the processes involved in the taking in and the utilization of food substances by which growth, repair and maintenance of the body are accomplished.  
•	To ensure optimum growth, newborns need to be well breastfed. 
•	The WHO recommends 6 months exclusive breastfeeding.  
• 	Benefits for Baby 
•	Balance of nutrition (fat, protein, etc.) adjusts to age of baby 
•	Breast milk has micronutrients not found in formula 
•	Less infant illness, including allergies, ear infections, stomach upsets 
•	Less childhood asthma and better vision 
•	Less adult illness, including diabetes, cancer, heart disease 
•	Protection against many childhood diseases, since breast milk contains antibodies from the mother 
• 	Benefits for Mother 
•	Easier bonding with baby 
•	Reduced risk of breast cancer and osteoporosis 
•	Natural contraception (with exclusive breast-feeding, for 
•	several months) 
•	Satisfaction of meeting infant’s basic need 
•	Malnutrition: Occurs when the child or newborn is not well fed. The child lacks nutrients in the right proportions. Example of malnutrition include: 
•	Protein-calorie malnutrition: A condition in which a person does not consume sufficient food. This can result in illness, severe weight loss, and even death. 
•	Stunting: The failure of children to grow to a normal height for their age due to severe and chronic malnutrition. 
•	Wasting: The tendency for children to be severely underweight for their age as a result of malnutrition.  
•	Marasmus: A disease of severe protein-calorie malnutrition during early infancy, in which growth stops, body tissues waste away, and the infant eventually dies. 
•	Kwashiorkor: A disease of chronic malnutrition in which a protein-calorie deficiency makes a child more vulnerable to other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and influenza. 
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDHOOD 
•	Mastery of gross and fine motor skills results not only from body growth and maturation but also from extensive, active play. 
•	Adults need to make sure children have a safe space to play, with ample time, appropriate equipment, and active playmates. 
•	“Safe space to play” cannot be taken for granted because the environment is the third teacher.  
•	The environment  has the power to enhance children’s sense of wonder and capacity for learning” 
•	Good nutrition needed for healthy childhood development. Appetite decreases between ages 2 and 6 because young children naturally grow more slowly than they did as infants. Moreover, if children play less outside, they burn fewer calories. 
•	Children learn self-help skills such as becoming self-sufficient at dressing and feeding and mastering shoe tying skills. 
•	The child also learns to draw and write. They scribble, colour pictures at 3-4 years and are able make more realistic drawing at 6.  
•	Beyond the sheer fun of playing, the benefits of physical activity—especially games with rules, which children now can follow—last a lifetime. 
•	Play is form of exercise that advances physical, emotional, and mental health. Exercise improves academic achievement.  
 
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT IN ADOLESCENCE 
•	One of the major physical changes that occur in adolescence is the onset of puberty 
•	Puberty: The time at the end of childhood between the first onrush of growth hormones and full adult size. Puberty usually lasts three to five years. Many more years are required to achieve psychosocial maturity 
•	Different changes occur for both boys and girls. 
•	Menarche: A girl’s first menstrual period, signaling that she has begun ovulation. Pregnancy is biologically possible, but ovulation and menstruation are often irregular for years after menarche. 
•	Spermarche:  A boy’s first ejaculation of sperm. Erections can occur as early as infancy, but ejaculation signals sperm production. Spermarche may occur during sleep (in a “wet dream”) or via direct stimulation. • 	These changes are made possible by hormones 
• 	Signs of Puberty in Boys 
•	Testicles get bigger and the scrotum begins to thin and redden 
•	Pubic hair also starts to appear at the base of the penis and underarm hair starts to grow 
•	Breasts can swell slightly temporarily – this is normal and not the same as "man-boobs" • 	Boys start to sweat more 
•	Boys may have "wet dreams" (involuntary ejaculations of semen as they sleep) 
•	Their voice "breaks" and gets permanently deeper – for a while, a boy might find his voice goes very deep one minute and very high the next. 
• 	Signs Of Puberty In Girls 
•	Breasts begin to develop and grows larger in size. 
•	Pubic hair also starts to grow, and some girls may notice more hair on their legs and arms. 
•	Girls usually have their first period 
•	Pubic hair becomes coarser and curlier 
•	Underarm hair begins to grow – some girls also have hair in other parts of their body, such as their top lip, and this is completely normal 
•	Girls start to sweat more 
•	Girls have a white vaginal discharge 
•	Girls often get acne – a skin condition that shows up as different types of spots, including whiteheads, blackheads and pus-filled spots called pustules 
•	Most girls gain weight (which is normal) as their body shape changes – girls develop more body fat along their upper arms, thighs and upper back; their hips grow rounder and their waist gets narrower 
  
•	Though these changes occur for both boys and girls, there are variations in onset and duration which may result from the following 
•	Genetic: African Americans reach puberty, on average, about seven months earlier than European or Hispanic Americans; Chinese Americans average several months later. 
•	Gender: In height, the average girl is two years ahead of the average boy: The female height spurt occurs before menarche, whereas for boys the increase in height is relatively late, after spermarche. 
•	Nutrition: Girls who eat healthy reach menarche years earlier than malnourished ones do. 
•	Stress: Stress hastens the hormonal onset of puberty, especially if a child’s parents are sick, drug-addicted, or divorced, or if the neighborhood is violent and impoverished. 
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (JEAN PIAGET THEORY) 
Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development  
•	His theory suggests that intelligence changes as children grow and that move through four different stages of mental development.  
•	Sensorimotor stage: birth to 18-24 months 
•	Preoperational stage: 2 to 7 years 
•	Concrete operational stage: 7 to 11 years 
•	Formal operational stage: ages 12 and up 
 
  
	His theory focuses not only on understanding how children acquire knowledge, but also on understanding the nature of intelligence. 
	The sequence of the stages is universal across cultures and follow the same invariant (unchanging) order. All children go through the same stages in the same order (but not all at the same rate). 
• 	Stage 1- Sensorimotor intelligence 
•	Piaget’s term for the way infants think—by using their senses and motor skills—during the first period of cognitive development. 
•	According to Piaget children gain intelligence through their interactions with objects and are in a continuous process of constructing mental models (schemas) of how the world works from the ever-evolving nature of these interactions. 
•	There are six substages under the sensorimotor stage of cognitive development.  
•	Stage one (birth to 1 month) Reflexes: sucking, grasping, staring, and listening. 
•	Stage Two (1–4 months) the first acquired adaptations: accommodation and coordination of reflexes.  
•	Adaptation involves the child's changing to meet situational demands.  
•	Adaptation involves two sub‐processes: assimilation and accommodation.  
•	Assimilation is the application of previous concepts to new concepts. An example is the child who refers to a whale as a “fish.” 
•	Accommodation is the altering of previous concepts in the face of new information. An example is the child who discovers that some creatures living in the ocean are not fish, and then correctly refers to a whale as a “mammal.” 
•	Stage Three (4–8 months) Making interesting sights last: responding to people and objects e.g. clapping hands when mother says child’s name 
•	Stage Four (8–12 months) New adaptation and anticipation: becoming more deliberate and purposeful in responding to people and objects. 
•	Stage Five (12–18 months) New means through active experimentation: experimentation and creativity in the actions of the “little scientist” e. g., putting a teddy bear in the toilet and flushing it. 
•	Stage Six (18–24 months) New means through mental combinations: thinking before doing, new ways of achieving a goal without resorting to trial and error 
•	By the end of the sensorimotor stage, the child obtain object permanence - the realization that objects (including 
people) still exist even if they can no longer be seen, touched, or heard.   
 
 
 
• 	Stage 2 - Preoperational Thought 
•	Preoperational intelligence is the second of Piaget’s four periods of cognitive development. He used the prefix pre- because children do not yet use logical operations (reasoning processes) 
•	Language skills enables symbolic thought- when an object or word can stand for something else, including something out of sight or imagined. Words are used to symbolize an object or action.  
 
•	Symbolic thought helps explain animism, the belief of many young children that natural objects (such as a tree or a cloud) are alive and that nonhuman animals have the same characteristics as the child. Many children’s stories include animals or objects that talk and listen. Children talk and play with inanimate objects as humans. 
•	Centration is the tendency to focus (to center) on only one aspect of a situation. Young children may, for example, insist that Daddy is a father, not a brother, because they center on the role that he fills for them.  
                                      
•	The daddy example illustrates a particular type of centration that Piaget called egocentrism—literally, “self- centeredness.” 
•	Egocentrism: Piaget’s term for children’s tendency to think about other people and their own experiences as if everything revolves around them. The inability to take each other’s view due to selfishness. 
•	Focus on appearance- A characteristic of preoperational thought in which a young child assumes that the visible appearance of someone or something is also their essence. 
•	Static reasoning- A characteristic of preoperational thought in which a young child thinks that nothing changes. Whatever is now has always been and always will be. 
•	Irreversibility- In preoperational thought, the idea that change is permanent, that nothing can be restored to the way it was before a change occurred.  
•	Conservation- The principle that the amount of a substance remains the same (i.e., is conserved) even when its appearance changes. 
                               
• 	Stage 3 - Concrete operational thought 
•	Piaget’s term for the ability to reason logically about direct experiences and perceptions. 
•	Classification- The logical principle that things can be organized into groups (or categories or classes) according to some characteristic they have in common. 
•	Seriation-The concept that things can be arranged in a logical series, such as the number series or the alphabet. 
                                                      
• 	Stage 4- Formal Operational Thought Or Intelligence  
•	Adolescents move past concrete operational thinking and consider abstractions. Jean Piaget described a shift to formal operational thought, including “assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality” (Piaget, 1950/2010, p. 148). 
•	Adolescent egocentrism:  a characteristic of adolescent thinking that leads young people to believe in their own uniqueness, and to imagine that other people are also focused on them. 
                                    
•	Personal fable: The belief that one’s own emotions, experiences, and destiny are unique, more wonderful or awful than anyone else’s. 
•	Invincibility fable:  The fantasy that a person cannot be harmed by anything that might defeat a normal mortal, such as unprotected sex, drug abuse, or high-speed driving.  
•	Imaginary audience:  The other people who, in an adolescent’s egocentric belief, watch his or her appearance, ideas, and behavior. 
•	Egocentrism can coexist with more logical and abstract intelligence 
•	Hypothetical thought: Reasoning that includes propositions and possibilities that do not reflect reality. 
•	Deductive reasoning:  Reasoning from a general statement, premise, or principle, through logical steps, to figure out (deduce) specifics. (Also called top-down reasoning.) 
•	Inductive reasoning: Reasoning from specific experiences or facts to reach (induce) a general conclusion. (Also called bottom-up reasoning.) 
 
VYGOTSKY THEORY: SOCIAL LEARNING 
•	Vygotsky emphasized another side of early cognition, the social aspects. He stressed the power of culture. He believed that learning is not done in isolation; according to many contemporary educators, it depends on joint engagement. 
•	Mentor- Someone who teaches or guides someone else, helping a learner master a skill or body of knowledge.  
                                           
•	Zone of proximal development (ZPD)- In sociocultural theory, a metaphorical area, or “zone,” surrounding a learner that includes all the skills, knowledge, and concepts that the person is close (“proximal”) to acquiring but cannot yet master without help. 
•	Scaffolding- Temporary support that is tailored to a learner’s needs and abilities and aimed at helping the learner take the next. 
 
                                     INTELLIGENCE 
•	Defining and classifying intelligence is extremely complicated. Theories of intelligence range from having one general intelligence (g), to certain primary mental abilities, and to multiple category-specific intelligences. 
•	Some define intelligence as having higher level abilities (such as abstract reasoning, mental representation, problem solving, and decision making), the ability to learn, emotional knowledge, creativity, and adaptation to meet the demands of the environment effectively. 
Spearman’s General Intelligence (g) 
Charles Spearman, an English psychologist, established the two-factor theory of intelligence back in 1904 (Spearman, 1904). 
•	General intelligence, also known as g factor, refers to a general mental ability that, according to Spearman, underlies multiple specific skills, including verbal, spatial, numerical, and mechanical. 
•	Spearman also stated a second factor, s, which refer to an individual’s specific ability in one particular area (Spearman, as cited in Thomson, 1947). 
  
GARDNER’S MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES 
•	American psychologist Howard Gardner built off the idea that there are multiple forms of intelligence. 
•	He proposed that there is no single intelligence, but rather distinct, independent multiple intelligences exist, each representing unique skills and talents relevant to a certain category. 
 
•	Gardner (1983, 1987)  proposed seven multiple intelligences: i. 	linguistic ii. 	logical-mathematical ii. 	spatial iv. 	musical 
v. 	bodily-kinesthetic vi. 	Interpersonal and intrapersonal. ii. 	Naturalist intelligence. 
                                                                 
 	 
STERNBERG’S TRIARCHIC THEORY OF INTELLIGENCE 
•	Robert Sternberg proposed a three-category theory of intelligence. This theory is based on the definition of intelligence as the ability to achieve success based on your personal standards and your sociocultural context. 
•	According to the triarchic theory, intelligence has three aspects: analytical, creative, and practical (Sternberg, 1985). 
•	Analytical intelligence, also referred to as componential intelligence, refers to intelligence that is applied to analyze or evaluate problems and arrive at solutions. This is what a traditional IQ test measure. 
•	Creative intelligence is the ability to go beyond what is given to create novel and interesting ideas. This type of intelligence involves imagination, innovation and problem-solving. 
•	Practical intelligence is the ability that individuals use to solve problems faced in daily life, when a person finds the best fit between themselves and the demands of the environment. 
•	Adapting to the demands environment involves either utilizing knowledge gained from experience to purposefully change oneself to suit. 
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 
•	Emotional Intelligence is the “ability to monitor one’s own and other people’s emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour” (Salovey and Mayer, 1990). 
•	Emotional intelligence is important in our everyday lives, seeing as we experience one emotion or another nearly every second of our lives. You may not associate emotions and intelligence with one another, but in reality, they are very related. 
•	Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and to reason and problem-solve on the basis of them (Mayer, Caruso, & Salovey, 1999).  
•	The four key components of emotional Intelligence are  
•	(i) self-awareness 
•	(ii) self-management 
•	(iii) social awareness 
•	(iv) Relationship management. 
                          
•	In other words, if you are high in emotional intelligence, you can accurately perceive emotions in yourself and others (such as reading facial expressions), use emotions to help facilitate thinking, understand the meaning behind your emotions (why are you feeling this way?), and know how to manage your emotions (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). 
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT - EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
•	Classroom and co-curricular activities that involve physical strength for motor, speed and accuracy and coordination of bodily parts should be adopted to variations in physical and motor development. 
•	Varied sports and games, suitable for all types of, children, should be provided in daily school functioning. 
•	Crafts-work in school is a very valuable activity for the optimum physical growth and motor development and should form an integral part of the curriculum.  
•	Adaptation of instruction to the learner's development level. It is important that the content of instruction needs to be consistent with the developmental level of the learner. 
•	A focus on the process of children’s thinking, not just its products. In addition to checking the correctness of children’s answers, teachers must understand the processes children use to get to the answer.  
•	Recognition of the crucial role of children’s self-initiated, active involvement in learning activities.  
•	In a Piagetian classroom the presentation of ready-made knowledge is deemphasized, and children are encouraged to discover for themselves through spontaneous interaction with the environment.  
•	Therefore, instead of teaching didactically, teachers provide a rich variety of activities that permit children to act directly on the physical world. 
 
WEEK 5 – SOCIOEMOTIONAL AND MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	Socioemotional development in infancy, childhood and adolescence  
•	Erik Erikson theory of psychosocial development 
•	Moral development in infancy, childhood and adolescence 
•	Piaget’s theory of moral development • 	Kohlberg’s theory of moral development 
•	Educational Implications. 
SOCIOEMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Infancy: Early Emotions- happiness, sadness, anger, fear 
Social smile:  A smile evoked by a human face, normally first evident in full-term infants about 6 weeks after birth.  
 
Separation anxiety: Distress when a familiar caregiver or loved one leaves; most obvious between 9 and 14 months.  
Stranger wariness:  An infant’s expression of concern—a quiet stare while clinging to a familiar person, or a look of fear—when a stranger appears. 
Self-awareness:  A person’s realization that he or she is a distinct individual whose body, mind, and actions are separate from those of other people. 
•	Attachment:  According to Ainsworth, “an affectional tie” that an infant forms with a caregiver—a tie that binds them together in space and endures over time. 
•	Infants show their attachment through 
i.	Proximity-seeking (such as approaching and following    their caregivers) and through 
ii.	Contact-maintaining (such as touching, snuggling, and holding). 
•	Secure attachment: A relationship in which an infant obtains both comfort and confidence from the presence of his or her caregiver. 
•	Insecure-avoidant attachment:  A pattern of attachment in which an infant avoids connection with the, caregiver, as when the infant seems not to care about the caregiver’s presence, departure, or return. 
•	Insecure-resistant/ambivalent attachment:  A pattern of attachment in which an infant’s anxiety and uncertainty are evident, as when the infant becomes very upset at separation from the caregiver, such infants both resist and seek contact on reunion. 
•	Disorganized attachment:  A type of attachment that is marked by an infant’s inconsistent reactions to the caregiver’s departure and return. 
• 	Childhood- Children develop socioemotionally through play  • 	Pretend Play: This the play that often occurs when a child is alone  
•	Social Play: This the play that occurs with playmates. 
•	Rough-and-tumble play- Play that seems to be rough, as in play wrestling or chasing, but in which there is no intent to harm. 
•	Sociodramatic play-Pretend play in which children act out various roles and themes in plots or roles that they create • 	Adolescence - Relationships  
•	Adolescence is often characterized as a time when children distance themselves from their elders. 
•	Parent–adolescent relationships are pivotal, not always peaceful (Laursen & Collins, 2009) and disputes are common because the drive for independence. 
•	Parental friendship and monitoring is needed to guide adolescents and help them make the right choices. 
•	Parental monitoring: Parents’ ongoing awareness of what their children are doing, where, and with whom. 
•	Adolescents rely on peers to help them navigate the physical changes of puberty, the intellectual challenges of high school, and the social changes of leaving childhood. 
•	Peer relationships can help adolescents cultivate either good or bad behaviours 
•	Peer pressure: When people of the same age group encourage particular behavior, dress, and attitude.  
This is usually considered negative, when peers encourage behavior that is contrary to norms or morals, but can also be positive 
Of late it is very common to see adolescents in romantic relationships with early sexual debuts 
Many adolescents have strong sexual urges but minimal logic about pregnancy and disease and this requires the need for extensive sex education; first from the family, school and other social institutions 
ERIK ERIKSON – PSYCHOSOCIAL STAGES OF DEV’TSTAGE PSYCHOSOCIAL CRISIS                BASIC VIRTUE 	          AGE 
•	1. 	           Trust vs. Mistrust 	            Hope                 	0 - 1½

•	8. 	        Ego Integrity vs. Despair 	     Wisdom       65+ 
 
TRUST VS. MISTRUST 
This stage begins at birth continues to approximately 18 months of age.  
•	During this stage, the infant is uncertain about the world in which they live, and looks towards their primary caregiver for stability and consistency of care. 
•	If the care the infant receives is consistent, predictable and reliable, they will develop a sense of trust which will carry with them to other relationships, and they will be able to feel secure even when threatened. 
•	If these needs are not consistently met, mistrust, suspicion, and anxiety may develop 
 
AUTONOMY VS. SHAME 
•	This stage occurs between the ages of 18 months to approximately 3 years. According to Erikson, children at this stage are focused on developing a sense of personal control over physical skills and a sense of independence. 
•	Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of will. If children in this stage are encouraged and supported in their increased independence, they become more confident and secure in their own ability to survive in the world. 
 
              INITIATIVE VS. GUILT 
•	During the initiative versus guilt stage, children assert themselves more frequently through directing play and other social interaction. it is a “time of vigor of action and of behaviors that the parents may see as aggressive 
Central to this stage is play, as it provides children with the opportunity to explore their interpersonal skills through initiating activities. 
Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of purpose, while failure results in a sense of guilt 
During the initiative versus guilt stage, children assert themselves more frequently through directing play and other social interaction.  
•	It is a “time of vigor of action and of behaviors that the parents may see as aggressive 
•	Central to this stage is play, as it provides children with the opportunity to explore their interpersonal skills through initiating activities. 
•	Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of purpose, while failure results in a sense of guilt 
        INDUSTRY VS. INFERIORITY 
•	Occurs between ages of five and twelve.  
•	The child forms friendship with peers and now feels the need to win approval by demonstrating specific competencies that are valued by society and begin to develop a sense of pride in their accomplishments 
•	If children are encouraged and reinforced for their initiative, they begin to feel industrious (competent) and feel confident in their ability to achieve goals.  
•	If this initiative is not encouraged, if it is restricted by parents or teacher, then the child begins to feel inferior, doubting his own abilities and therefore may not reach his or her potential. 
•	Adolescence is often understood as a search for a consistent understanding of oneself.  
•	Self-expression and self-concept become increasingly important at puberty. Each young person wants to know, “Who am I?” 
        IDENTITY VS. ROLE CONFUSION 
•	This is a major stage of development where the child has to learn the roles he will occupy as an adult.  
•	It is during this stage that the adolescent will re-examine his identity and try to find out exactly who he or she is. Erikson suggests that two identities are involved: the sexual and the occupational. 
•	Identity achievement: Erikson’s term for the attainment of identity, or the point at which a person understands who he or she is as a unique individual, in accord with past experiences and future plans. This includes many identities— religions, sexual-gender, political-ethnic, and vocational. 
•	Role confusion: A situation in which people do not seem to know or care about their identity. (Sometimes called identity diffusion.) 
•	Foreclosure: Erikson’s term for premature identity formation, when a person adopts parents’ or society’s roles and values wholesale, without questioning or analysis. 
MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	The term moral comes from the Latin word “mores” meaning manners or pattern of behaviour that conform to the standard of a group or society.  
•	Morality refers to a sense of ethics of right or wrong. 
•	Moral development therefore is a process whereby individuals especially children come to adopt and internalized what is right or wrong in their society 
Moral development is the gradual development of an individual’s concept of right or wrong – conscious, religious values, social attitudes and certain behaviour.  
Moral development involves changes in thoughts, feelings and behaviours regarding standards of right and wrong. 
Moral development involves an interpersonal and intrapersonal dimension. 
•	Interpersonal is about our view of right or wrong based on what others say in the environment. 
•	Intrapersonal is about our view of right or wrong based on personalized convictions and philosophies. 
•	Moral development involves four questions 
•	Interpersonal is about our view of right or wrong based on what others say in the environment. 
•	Intrapersonal is about our view of right or wrong based on personalized convictions and philosophies. 
•	Moral development involves four questions 
AGENCIES OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
1.	The home: The home provides the first social environment where the child through his/her interaction with parents and sibling’s shapes the child moral development. 
2.	The school: one of the aims of education is to produce citizens that are honest and hardworking. These moral values are inherent in the Ghanaian culture. The aim of education therefore is to train the youth develop sound moral that will help in nation building.  
3.	The mass media: The various mass media namely TV, radio, internet, videos etc. teach children acceptable cultural practices and promote understanding of certain moral issues.  
4.	Peer group: Children as they grow turn to enjoy the company of their peers than their parents. As they are with their peers in the group, they learn to obey the rule and regulations of the group as well as respect for their colleagues which shapes their moral life.  
5.	Religious bodies: The church and Mosque teach acceptable behaviours through Sunday school and Qur’anic school and the preaching of sermons on morality during worships 
KOHLBERG’S THEORY OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
•	This theory is a stage theory. In other words, everyone goes through the stages sequentially without skipping any stage. 
•	However, movement through these stages are not natural, that is people do not automatically move from one stage to the next as they mature. 
•	In stage development, movement occurs when a person notices inadequacies in his or her present way of coping with a given moral dilemma. 
•	According to stage theory, people cannot understand moral reasoning more than one stage ahead of their own.  
•	For example, a person in Stage 1 can understand Stage 2 reasoning but nothing beyond that.  
•	Level 1-Pre-Conventional Moral Development 
•	Stage 1 and 2 
•	Level 2-Conventional Moral Development 
•	Stage 3 and 4 
 
Level 3-Post-Conventional Moral Development 
•	Stage 5 and 6 
PRE-CONVENTIONAL MORALITY 
• 	Stage 1 - Obedience and Punishment 
•	Especially common in young children, but adults are capable of expressing this type of reasoning. At this stage, children see rules as fixed and absolute. 
•	Obeys rules in order to avoid punishment. 
•	Determines a sense of right and wrong by what is punished and what is not punished. 
•	Obeys superior authority and allows that authority to make the rules, especially if that authority has the power to inflict pain. 
•	Is responsive to rules that will affect his/her physical well-being 
• 	Stage 2 – Naively Egotistical (self-interest/exchange) 
•	At this stage of moral development, children account for individual points of view and judge actions based on how they serve individual needs. 
•	Reciprocity is possible, but only if it serves one's own interests. It is motivated by vengeance (revenge) or “an eye for an eye” philosophy. 
•	Is self-absorbed while assuming that he/she is generous. 
•	Believes in equal sharing in that everyone gets the same, regardless of need. 
•	Believes that the end justifies the means. Will do a favor only to get a favour. Expects to be rewarded for every nonselfish deed he/she does. 
CONVENTIONAL MORALITY 
• 	Stage 3 – “Good Boy-Good Girl” Orientation 
•	This stage of moral development is focused on living up to social expectations and roles.  
•	There is an emphasis on conformity, being "nice," and consideration of how choices influence relationships. 
•	Finds peer approval very important 
•	Feels that intensions are as important as deeds and expects others to accept intentions or promises in place of deeds. 
•	Begins to put himself/herself in another’s shoes and think from another perspective. 
• 	Stage 4 – Law and Social Order 
•	At this stage of moral development, people begin to consider society as a whole when making judgments. The focus is on maintaining law and order by following the rules, doing one’s duty, and respecting authority. 
•	Is a duty doer who believes in rigid rules that should not be changed? 
•	Respects authority and obeys it without question 
•	Supports the rights of the majority without concern for those in the minority. 
•	Is part of about 80% of the population that does not progress past stage 4? 
POST-CONVENTIONAL MORALITY 
• 	Stage 5 - Legalistic Social Contract  
At this stage, people begin to account for the differing values, opinions, and beliefs of other people. Rules of law are important for maintaining a society, but members of the society should agree upon these standards. • 	Is motivated by the belief in the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people 
•	Believes in consensus (everyone agrees), rather than in majority rule. 
•	Respects the rights of the minority especially the rights of the individual. 
• 	Stage 6 – Universal Ethical Principles 
•	Kolhberg’s final level of moral reasoning is based upon universal ethical principles and abstract reasoning. At this stage, people follow these internalized principles of justice, even if they conflict with laws and rules.  
•	Believes that there are higher moral principles than those represented by social rules and customs 
•	Is willing to accept the consequences for disobedience of the social rule he/she has rejected  • 	Believes that the dignity of humanity is sacred and that all humans have value 
THE HEINZ DILEMMA 
A woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered.  
The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug.  
The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost.  
He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. 
According to Kohlberg, 
Stage One 
It’s wrong to steal the drug because "It’s against the law," or "It's bad to steal” Stage Two 
"Heinz might think it’s right to steal the drug, the druggist would not." Since everything is relative, each person is free to pursue his or her individual interests. 
•	Stage Three: It was okay to steal the drug- He was a good man for wanting to save her; his intentions were good. It was really the druggist's fault for overcharging. 
•	Stage Four: Concerned with society as a whole; emphasis is on obeying laws, respecting authority, and performing one's duties so that the social order is maintained. 
•	What would happen if we all started breaking the laws whenever we felt we had a good reason? The result would be chaos; society could not function. 
•	Stage Five: What makes a “good society?” There is a social contract that we agree to uphold until changed democratically. Heinz may be defended, though, on moral right to live. 
•	Stage Six: A “just” society. Treat the claims of all in an impartial manner, basic dignity of all as individuals is maintained. 
 
        WEEK 6 – LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 
•	Definition and meaning of Language 
•	Components of Language 
•	Stages in Language Development 
       MEANING OF LANGUAGE 
•	Santrock (2002) explains language as a form of communication, whether spoken, written or signed, that is based on a system of symbols.  
               
•	Language is also a system of conventional spoken, manual (signed), or written symbols by means of which human beings, as members of a social group and participants in its culture, express themselves (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). 
                           
•	From the definitions above every language  
i. 	Has symbols ii. 	Has rules governing how symbols are combined iii. 	Can either be spoken, written or signed 
       LANGUAGE VS SPEECH 
•	Language differs from speech in that, speech is the verbal or oral means of communicating any language. 
•	Speech has three components. These are: 
i. 	Articulation ii. 	Voice iii. 	Fluency       COMPONENTS OF SPEECH 
•	Articulation:  How speech sounds are made e.g. Children must learn the “r” sound in order to say “rabbit” rather than “wabbit” 
•	Voice:The use of the vocal folds and breathing to produce sound 
•	Fluency: The rhythm of speech; (hesitations or stuttering can affect fluency). 
             COMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE 
•	Language is made up of five main component parts.  
•	We will now consider each of these in turn in order to get a better understanding of this complex system, and how the different parts of it develop. 
                                                               
        PHONOLOGY 
•	When we talk about phonology, we are talking about the sound system of a language. Every language has sound systems including both international and local languages. 
•	The basic sounds of language called are phonemes. The phonemes of a language are combined to produce words and sentences. 
•	For example in the English language, there are vowel sounds (e.g. /a/, /i/, /o/, /u/, /æ/ etc) and consonant sounds (e.g. /p/, /m/, /d/, /n/, /s/ etc.). The word “cut” is therefore made of the sounds- /cɅt/. 
        MORPHOLOGY 
•	It refers to the study word formation or to the branch of linguistics that deals with words, their internal structure, and how they are formed and their relationship to other words in the same language. 
•	A "morpheme" is a short segment of language (smallest language units) that carries meaning.  
•	Some words consists of a single morpheme like for instance “friend” or “help”. Others have two or more. E.g. the word “prenatal” is made up of two morphemes, “pre” (before) and “natal” (birth). 
         SYNTAX 
•	Syntax refers to the way in which words can be acceptably combined to create sentences or phrases in a given language.  
•	Syntax is the grammatical arrangement of sentences. It is a system of rules that specify how words and phrases are arranged to create sentences. E.g. 
i. 	I am going to the shop – syntactically correct ii. 	I am to the shop going – syntactically incorrect iii. 	The boy ate the food – grammatically correct iv. 	The food ate the boy– grammatically incorrect 
         SEMANTICS 
•	This refers to the part of language to do with the meanings of words, and also of sentences.  
•	Knowledge of the meaning of words also includes knowledge of semantically related words and the differences between them. For example “cat and kitten” and “dog and puppy”  
•	It equally includes words that have same spelling but different meaning also called homonyms. E.g. 
•	The word “pen” can mean the writing instrument or enclosure for an animal.  
          PRAGMATICS 
•	Pragmatics is the study of how both literal and nonliteral aspects of communicated linguistic meaning that speaks to the physical or social context (broadly construed) in which language is used. 
•	Pragmatics refers to the social part of language and determines how language can be used appropriately in different contexts, and how meanings can be conveyed which go beyond the words themselves. 
•	This includes the use of idiomatic expressions, metaphors etc. e.g.  
•	Mr. Adu died last Friday can be put as Mr. Adu kicked the bucket last Friday.  
Subtitle page 1 
•	All children are able to develop language through a series of four distinct stages. These stages are:  
i. 	The Preverbal Pre-linguistic Stage:                                                          (Non-verbal communication from birth-twelve (12) months) ii. 	Single-word/ holophrastic period (12-18 months) iii. 	Multiword/Telegraphic period (18-26 months) iv. 	Emerging Grammars/ Acquisition of Rules (2-3years) 
PREVERBAL/ PRE-LINGUISTIC STAGE (0-12 MONTHS) 
•	It is characterized by the development of early communicative and cognitive abilities. These include the development of attention, gestures and gaze, turn taking, patterns, relating to objects and special relations.  
•	The earliest sounds or vocalizations infants produce are non-speech utterances like whimpers, cries, grunts, burps, gestures, imitations among others. 
•	Children use them to communicate discomfort, satiation or positive emotions. These are termed pre-linguistic communication.  
•	The next vocal milestone, at about 3 to 5 weeks of age, is cooing: repeating vowel - like sounds such as “cocoh”, “aaah”. 
•	From six (6) or seven (7) months, babies utterances begin to include the repetition of certain syllables (mama-ma, da-da-da, ba-ba-ba) a phenomenon referred to as babbling because of the way it sounds. 
•	The timing is determined by biological readiness and not the ability to hear (Loclee, 1993). 
•	Babbling perhaps enables the baby to exercise its vocal cords and helps develop articulation. Since babies everywhere starts babbling at about the same age and produce similar range of early sounds (Stoel-Gammon, 1986).  
        SINGLE-WORD/ HOLOPHRASTIC PERIOD (12-18 MONTHS) 
•	This stage is marked by the child's ability to say or use single words consistently and intentionally to refer to objects, people or events. These words are called Holophrases. 
•	A Holophrases is a one-word utterance that represents an entire phrase or sentence e.g. book may mean I want my book or this is my book etc.  
•	These normally include names of important people like parents (dada or mama), familiar animals, and “akuko” that is chicken, “koko” (porridge) for food, “nsu” for water and greetings (bye).  
•	By the end of this period, the child has a core vocabulary of at least eighty (80) words (Clanle, 1983).  
•	However, you should bear in mind that they can understand more words (receptive vocabulary) spoken by others than what they can actually produce (Expressive vocabulary) to express themselves (Dan and Gleason, 2001). 
•	This gap is known as expressive lag. This linguistic phenomenon means that even though words cannot be expressed, children can nevertheless, understand words or directions spoken by adults. 
•	For example, a child of eleven months might be able to follow the direction "come here" or give me the book; yet lacks the linguistic ability to express the same sentence or even parts of it. 
•	Sometimes too, not all words spoken at this stage are clearly understood by the child. This means there is equally a gap between what the child can speak and what they can understand. This called the receptive lag. 
The children’s’ vocabularies soon begin to grow at a rapid pace and some learn as many as twenty (20) new words every week. However, these toddlers make errors, such as over-extensions and under extensions (Miller, 1991).  
•	An over-extension occurs when a child incorrectly uses a word to describe a wider set of objects. For example a child’s family dog may be named Brownie and so the child calls every dog she sees Brownie. 
•	Under extension on the other hand is the application of a word to only one object. For instance cat may be used to name only the family cat, and no other type of cat. 
             MULTIWORD/TELEGRAPHIC PERIOD (18-26 MONTHS) 
•	This stage is characterized by a gradual shift from single-word statements to two (2) and three (3) word statements. 
•	These early combinations are sometimes called telegraphic speech because they resemble the abbreviated language of a telegram. 
•	Children usually form their first sentences by linking two words. The two-word sentence conveys a single thought. 
•	Two-word utterances are referred to as telegraphic speech. They are telegraphic because they coded like telegrams.  
•	It consists mainly of content words; articles prepositions and other less critical omitted words. 
•	Therefore, their statements lack grammar. However, they convey a meaningful thought.  
•	Examples are; a child may say “give doll” instead of “please give me doll”. Other examples are see doggie, mama walk, give papa, cut knife and where ball?  
•	Here the child has a core vocabulary size of two hundred (200) to three hundred (300) words. 
           EMERGING GRAMMARS/ ACQUISITION OF RULES (2-3YEARS) 
•	This stage of language development is characterized by an increase in word order, sentence organization, length and development of grammar. 
•	By the end of their third year, most children most children can express such as plural or the past tense.  
•	However, their efforts to learn the rules of language continue to generate revealing mistakes like over regularization. 
•	Over regularization occurs when grammatical rules are incorrectly generalized to irregular ones where they do not apply. 
•	For instance, a child may say “I eated fried rice”, “My mother buyed me a dress”, “she singed at church” among others. Cross-cultural research suggests that these over regularizations occur in all languages (Slogin, 1988). 
•	By the end of this period, the child may have a vocabulary size of between nine hundred (900) to one- thousand (1000) words may use twelve thousand (12000) per day. 
•	It is important to note that children vary enormously in their rate of language development.  
•	Therefore, chronological age may not be a good index of a child’s linguistic level.  
 
WEEK 7: THEORIES OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT                          
                                                      
NATIVISTS PERSPECTIVE (BIOLOGICAL) 
•	Noam Chomsky is a leading linguist who has suggested that humans are born with something called a language acquisition device (LAD). 
•	Language acquisition device: a biologically based innate capacity for language, independent of any specific natural language, that enables a child exposed to adult speech to implement certain general principles for discovering the grammatical rules of the specific language in question. 
•	Chomsky believed that regardless of country, culture or which specific language is to be learned, children reach certain developmental language milestones at roughly the same points in development. 
•	The nativists also propose the critical period hypothesis which is the assumption that preschool children acquire their first language far more easily at between particular age periods. 
•	Nativists believe argued that human beings are most proficient at language learning during the period between age 2 and puberty. 
Innate, inherent or biological.  
Nativists Perspective (Biological) 
•	Some scholars believe that the LAD might represent a particular part of the brain where language is localized. 
Research evidence has revealed particular parts of the brain which are involved in language. 
•	Theses two areas are the Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area. 
•	The cerebral cortex (outer layer) of the brain is divided into four lobes namely the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. 
•	The Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe and the Wernicke’s area is located in the temporal lobe.  
NATIVISTS PERSPECTIVE (BIOLOGICAL) 
  
• The Broca’s area is responsible for: 
i. 	regulating breathing patterns while speaking  ii. 	ii. Vocalizations required for normal speech. iii. 	 iii. Coordinating the activities of the muscles of respiration, the larynx, the pharynx, as well as those of the cheeks, lips, jaws, and tongue. iv. 	 • If a person has damage to Broca's area, sounds can be made, but words cannot be formed. 
The Wernicke’s area is responsible for: 
i.	Regulating the comprehension of speech or receptive language. 
ii.	Recognizing phonemes and words and reading Damage to the area of the brain results in difficulty or inability in comprehension of meaningful language. 
Other include Slobin who believes that children have any innate knowledge of language as Chomsky did, but he thinks that they have an inborn Language-Making Capacity (LMC) (Slobin, 1985). 
 • The LMC is a set of cognitive and perceptual abilities that are highly specialized for language learning. • These inherent mechanisms (LADs or LMCs) perhaps allow young infants to use language easily.  
Behavioural Perspective (Skinner and Bandura) 
•	Skinner, one of the prominent behaviourist argues that children learn to speak appropriately because they are reinforced or rewarded for grammatical and semantically accurate speech. 
•	Adults shape a child's language by selectively reinforcing those aspects of babbling that are most like adult speech, thereby increasing the probability that these sounds will be repeated.  
• Language acquisition is an operant behaviour where children add new words to their vocabulary using three techniques called namely; the tact, the mand and the echoic acquisition methods. 
•	The Tact Method: This is a system that enables children to learn new words through responses to stimulus objects in their environment. 
•	This method allows the child to verbally name common objects or people because the child makes contact with these objects or people in his or her environment. 
•	The Mand Method: Through the mand or (demand) method, a child acquires words simply because the words meet a need. 
•	Thus, children learn the word food and some of its sub-classes such as toffee and meat because they know that these names represent objects that satisfy their hunger. 
•	Other conditions such as thirst and fatigue cause children to learn other new words to verbalize needs.  
•	The echoic method: This is verbal acquisition through imitation of adult speech. Imitation is, however, not the only principle in operation here. 
•	Reinforcement is particularly important. 
•	When a child speaks appropriate words or uses correct grammar and parents, adults or teachers reinforce them, they are motivated to learn other new words. Interactionists Perspective (Piaget and Vygotsky) 
•	Interactionists believe that language acquisition is innate however they believe is not automatic. They believe that verbal exchanges with parents and others play a critical role in developing language skills. 
•	Thus, interactionist theorists maintain that both an innate predisposition and a supportive environment contribute to language development of a person. 
•	Two of the prominent interactionist are Piaget and Vygotsky. 
•	Piaget described a phenomenon called egocentric speech. 
•	He observed the chattering of preschool children and noticed that they often talked to themselves as they went about their daily activities. 
•	E.g. “Put the big piece in the corner. Not that one, the pink one!”  
•	Egocentric speech is an indication of cognitive maturity and shows that the child can no longer see the world through the eyes of others.  
•	Later, children develop social speech with which they can listen and exchange ideas. 
• Vygotsky on the other hand believed that language 
i. 	serves as the primary vehicle through which adults pass culturally valued modes of thinking and problem solving to their children, and. ii. 	 ii. becomes a more powerful tools of intellectual adaptation in children iii. 	 • Vygotsky on other hand called the conversation that children have with themselves private speech. 
iv. 	 • He believed that private speech helps young children plan strategies and regulate their behaviour so that they are more likely to accomplish their goals. 
LANGUAGE DISORDERS 
•	These are disorders associated with the difficulty or inability to express oneself using language or to understand spoken language 
. • Language disorders are caused by damage to certain parts of the brain namely the Broca’s area or the Wernicke’s areas which are localized brain areas for language. 
•	Language disorder is also termed Aphasia. 
•	There are two main types of Aphasia namely Broca’s Aphasia and Wernicke’s Aphasia. 
Broca’s Aphasia 
•	This syndrome, also known as expressive, non-fluent, or motor aphasia, is named for neurologist Paul Broca, who first described it in 1861. 
•	It is caused by damage to the Broca’s area caused by lesion or infarct. 
•	The major feature of Broca’s aphasia is a severe non-fluency of speech, which may be so extreme as to render the patient mute. More often, speech is limited to a few stereotyped expressions or expletives. 
Wernicke’s Aphasia 
•	This type of aphasia, known as sensory, receptive, or fluent aphasia. 
•	It is caused by damage to the Wernicke’s area caused by lesion or infarct. 
•	The main hallmarks of Wernicke’s aphasia include a severe comprehension deficit that affects the understanding of both spoken and written language, as well as fluent, grammatically correct, but nonsensical speech and writing. 
•	Because the patient is unable to understand what is said, repetition is also impaired. Speech Disorders 
•	A person has a speech disordser when a person is unable to produce speech sounds correctly (articulation disorder) 
•	E.g. “eat” for “heat”, “unberievable” for “unbelievable”, “belet” for belt”, “schleep” for “sleep” (Hewards & Orlansky, 1992) or 
•	Speech disorders can affect the fluently with which a person speaks  • E.g stammering and stuttering –Kkkwa kwaaa mmme-Kwame. 
•	Many speech disorders exist namely Stuttering, Apraxia, and Dysarthria.  
Stuttering 
•	Stuttering refers to a speech disorder that interrupts the flow of speech. People who stutter can experience the following types of disruption: 
•	Repetitions occur when people involuntarily repeat sounds, vowels, or words. 
•	Blocks happen when people know what they want to say but have difficulty making the necessary speech sounds. Blocks may cause someone to feel as though their words are stuck. 
•	Prolongations refer to the stretching or drawing out of particular sounds or words. 
•	The symptoms of stuttering can vary depending on the situation. 
•	Stress, excitement, or frustration can cause stuttering to become more severe. Some people may also find that certain words or sounds can make a stutter more pronounced. 
•	Stuttering can cause both behavioral and physical symptoms that occur at the same time. These can include: 
•	Tension in the face and shoulders and rapid blinking 
•	lip tremors 
•	clenched fists 
•	Sudden head movements 
•	There are two main types of stuttering: 
•	Developmental stuttering affects young children who are still learning speech and language skills. Genetic factors significantly increase a person’s likelihood of developing this type of stutter. 
•	Neurogenic stuttering occurs when damage to the brain prevents proper coordination between the different regions of the brain that play a role in speech. Apraxia 
•	Apraxia is a general term referring to brain damage that impairs a person’s motor skills, and it can affect any part of the body. 
•	Apraxia of speech, or verbal apraxia, refers specifically to the impairment of motor skills that affect an individual’s ability to form the sounds of speech correctly, even when they know which words they want to say. 
Dysarthria 
•	Dysarthria occurs when damage to the brain causes muscle weakness in a person’s face, lips, tongue, throat, or chest. Muscle weakness in these parts of the body can make speaking very difficult. 
•	People who have dysarthria may experience the following symptoms: 
•	slurred speech 
•	mumbling 
•	speaking too slowly or too quickly 
•	Soft or quiet speech  
• Difficulty moving the mouth or tongue  Factors Affecting Language Development 
•	Maturation 
•	Family income 
•	Sex 
•	School experience 
•	Physical factors/disease 
•	Level of intelligence 
•	Central Nervous System 
•	Motor system 
•	Cognitive abilities 
•	Social and Affective growth 
•	Responsive environment 
Characteristics that Interfere with Communication and Speech Development 
•	Hearing loss 
•	Language Disorders 
•	Visual Disability  
•	Cognitive Disability 
•	Emotional Problems 
•	Autism 
•	Lack of Interaction 
•	Structural abnormality 
•	Motor problems 
•	Voice disorders 
•	Disfluency disorders  
Educational Implications 
•	Oral activities including storytelling, describing pictures, active plays expose children to a lot of vocabulary and at the same time, offer them the opportunity to practice and solidify the vocabulary they have. 
•	Teachers should create and make use of language games. These are games that help the child recognize sounds, phrases and sentence that have been learnt. They stimulate speech articulation. 
•	Teachers should be good speech models for children to emulate or imitate. Educational Implications 
•	The teaching of vocabulary must always be followed by children’s use of this vocabulary to form sentences. 
•	Regular reading is important for language development. 
•	It is important that early childhood education providers implement the National Policy on Education provision that the language of instruction should be the mother tongue and that the second language should be taught as a subject.  
 
WEEK 8 – LEARNING 
•	Definition and meaning of learning 
•	Types of Learning 
-	Associative Learning (Classical and Operant Conditioning) 
-	Social learning theory 
	• 	Educational Implications and applications  
 
           Learning Defined 
•	Domjan (2010) defines learning is defined as a relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience.  
•	Almost all behaviours are learned e.g. writing, eating, walking, dancing etc. 
•	You would be unable to read, write, or speak if you had not learnt how to engage in these behaviours 
 
NB: Temporal behaviour changes do not qualify as learning. 
Types of Learning 
	• 	Associative learning 
 It occurs whenever a person or an animal forms a simple association among various stimuli and/or behaviors. In associative learning, responses/behaviors are preceded by an antecedent and followed by consequences 
•	Antecedents: Events that precede a response. 
•	Consequences: Effects that follow a response.  
•	The two major types of associative learning are classical conditioning and operant conditioning. 
 
                                                            Classical Conditioning 
•	Propounded by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian psychologist 
•	It learning that takes place when two stimuli are linked together to produce a new learned response in a person or animal. 
•	This learning occurs through the association of a neutral stimulus with a biologically potent stimulus. 
•	He did the famous classical conditioning experiment with a dog, meat powder and a bell.  
  
Elements of Classical Conditioning 
1.	Unconditioned stimulus (US): A stimulus innately capable of eliciting a response e.g. Meat powder 
2.	Unconditioned response (UR):  An innate reflex response elicited by an unconditioned stimulus e.g. Reflex salivation to the US 
3.	Neutral stimulus (NS): A stimulus that does not evoke the unconditioned response e.g. Bell before conditioning 
4.	Conditioned stimulus (CS): A stimulus that evokes a response because it has been repeatedly paired with an e.g. unconditioned stimulus Bell after conditioning 
5.	Conditioned response (CR): A learned response elicited by a conditioned stimulus e.g.  Salivation to the CS Principles of Classical Conditioning 
•	Acquisition: The period in conditioning during which a response is strengthened. 
•	Expectancy: An anticipation concerning future events or relationships. 
•	Extinction: The weakening of a conditioned response through removal of reinforcement. 
•	Spontaneous recovery: The reappearance of a learned response after its apparent extinction. 
Stimulus generalization: The tendency to respond to stimuli similar to but not identical to, a conditioned stimulus. 
•	Stimulus discrimination: The learned ability to respond differently to similar stimuli. 
Classroom Examples of Classical Conditioning 
•	A warm and nurturing teacher (US) makes students feel connected (UR). Students associate going to school 
(CS) with the teacher. Therefore, students learn to enjoy going to school (CR) 
•	A harsh and strict teacher (US) makes students feel bad (UR). Students associate going to school (CS) with the harsh teacher and learn to feel bad about going to school (CR). 
•	A child is laughed at (US) when he gave a presentation in class and he felt ashamed (UR). Now every time he has to speak up in front of people (CS), he feels nervous and fearful (CR). 
•	A child sees a dog attack a person. It’s a very frightening experience (UR). Dogs are generally neutral stimuli (US) that many people find adorable. But to this child, after this incident, he’s scared (CR) whenever he sees a dog (CS). 
•	Food poisoning can lead to a phobia of a specific food. The first time someone eats a certain food (US) and gets sick from it, they may associate the food with feeling awful (UR). The food’s appearance, smell, or taste (CS) can evoke an intense dislike or even fear in the person (CR). 
Operant/Instrumental Conditioning • 	Propounded by Edward Thorndike and B.F Skinner  
• 	This is the type of learning in which reinforcement or punishment are used to either increase or decrease the probability that a behavior will occur again. Hence the consequences of a response determine the probability of it being repeated. 
• 	Skinner did the famous Skinner box experiment while Thorndike did the puzzle box experiment. Skinner’s Experiment 
  
•	Skinner placed a hungry rat inside the Skinner box. The rat was initially inactive inside the box, but gradually as it began to adapt and explore around the box.  
•	The rat discovered a lever, pressed it and food was released inside the box. After eating, it explored again and  pressed the lever for the second time as it grew hungry again.  
•	This continued for some time and later the rat immediately pressed the lever once it was placed in the box.  
•	B.F. Skinner did another experiment. Here, he placed a rat in a box and subjected it  to unpleasant electric current. 
The rat experienced discomfort and started moving around the box. It accidentally knocked the lever. Pressing of the lever immediately seized the flow of unpleasant current.  
After a few times, the rat had smartened enough to go directly to the lever in order to prevent itself from the discomfort. 
Thorndike’s Experiment 
  
•	Thorndike placed a cat in the puzzle box and encouraged it to escape to reach a scrap of fish placed outside.   
•	Thorndike timed how long it took the cat to escape.  The cats experimented with different ways to escape the puzzle box and reach the fish. Eventually it stumbled upon a lever which opened the cage.   
•	When it had escaped it was put in again, and once more the time it took to escape was noted. Subsequently, the cat learned that pressing the lever had favorable consequences and adopted this behavior, becoming increasingly quick at pressing the lever. 
•	Thorndike came up with three laws. 
i.	The “Law of effect”  states that any behavior that is followed by pleasant consequences is likely to be repeated, and any behavior followed by unpleasant consequences is likely to be stopped. 
ii.	The “Law of exercise” states that  drill or practice helps in increasing efficiency and durability of learning. 
iii.	The “Law of readiness” states that learning takes place when an action tendency is aroused through preparatory adjustment, set or attitude. 
Classroom Examples of Operant Conditioning 
•	A student tends to complete his/her homework daily; because he/she knows that he/she will be rewarded with a candy (action) or praise (behavior). 
•	A student who always comes late to the class gets lashed every time in front of everyone. To prevent this, he/she may avoid coming late to the class. 
•	If a student is praised or complimented for doing a class presentation, he/she will be encouraged to do well, but if ridiculed in front of everyone, he or she may avoid such in the future.  
Everyday Examples of Operant Conditioning 
•	A driver is fined some amount, and his driving license is ceased for not following the traffic rules to deter him from doing such in the future. 
•	A child may learn to clean his/her room regularly; because he/she will be rewarded with extra TV hours every time he/she cleans up. 
•	Workers are often offered with the incentives and bonus in return of completing their targets in time or for regular attendance. It makes the workers to perform better, so that, they can continuously get those incentives and bonus. 
Reinforcement 
Any stimuli which strengthens or increases the probability of a specific response in the future. For example, if you want your dog to sit on command, you may give him a treat every time he sits for you.  Reinforcements strengthen behaviour. 
	• 	Reinforcer: Any event, item that reliably increases the probability or frequency of responses it follows. E.g. 
Candy 
Types of Reinforcement 
•	Positive Reinforcement:   It occurs when something pleasant is added in order to increase a response e.g. 
pens, erasers etc. 
•	Negative Reinforcement:  It occurs when something aversive is taken in order to increase a response e.g. Asking a child not to do a chore they dislike to increase a target behavior.  
•	A child who doesn’t like eating because she doesn’t enjoy vegetables can be reinforced by talking away the vegetables to make the child eat more. 
Schedules of Reinforcement 
•	Fixed Ratio refers to applying the reinforcement after a specific number of behaviors.  
•	Variable Ratio refers to applying a reinforcer after a variable number of responses.  
•	Fixed Interval is about applying the reinforcer after a specific amount of time.  
•	Variable Interval is about reinforcing someone after a variable amount of time is the final schedule 
 
 
Punishment 
•	Punishment is a term used in operant conditioning psychology to refer to any change that occurs after a behavior that reduces the likelihood that that behavior will occur again in the future. 
•	It refers to anything that decreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated. 
Types of Punishment 
Positive Punishment: This is when something aversive is added in order to decrease a behavior. The most common example of this is disciplining (e. g. beating) a child for misbehaving.  
Negative Punishment: When you remove something pleasant in order to decrease a behavior. Putting a child in a time-out until they can decrease their aggressive behavior, for instance, is an example of a negative punishment. 
LET’S DISCUSS 
WHY IS POSITIVE PUNISHMENT OR CORPORAL PUNISHMENT DISCOURAGED? 
Downsides of Positive Punishment 
•	Punished behavior is not forgotten, it's suppressed- behavior returns when punishment is no longer eminent. 
•	Creates fear that can generalize to desirable behaviors, e.g. fear of school, learned helplessness, depression. 
 Often ineffective unless it is given immediately after the undesirable behavior and each time the behavior occurs. 
Causes increased aggression- shows that aggression is a way to cope with problems-  Explains why aggressive delinquents and abusive parents come from abusive homes. 
•	Signals that an inappropriate behavior has occurred but does not specify what should be done instead. How to Make Punishment Work 
•	To make punishment work: 
•	Punishment should be swift. 
•	Punishment should be certain-every time. 
•	Punishment should be limited in time and intensity. 
•	Punishment should clearly target the behavior, not the person. 
•	Punishment should not give mixed messages. 
•	The most effective punishment is often omission training-negative punishment. 
Shaping 
•	The process of gradually molding responses to a final desired pattern.  
•	In shaping, successive attempts towards the desired behaviour are rewarded instead of waiting till the final behaviour is exhibited.  
•	It is used in animal training.  This is why animals on television and at amusement parks taught to perform complicated tricks? 
•	How can shaping be applied in the classroom? 
Social Learning Theory 
•	This theory was proposed by Albert Bandura. 
•	He emphasized the importance of observation, modelling, and imitation, attitudes, and emotional reactions of others in learning.  
•	The theory states that learning occurs from the environment through the process of observational learning. 
•	Observational learning posits that children observe the people around them behaving in various ways. This is illustrated during the famous Bobo doll experiment (Bandura, 1961). Bandura’s Bobo Doll Experiment 
  
•	There were two experimental groups, each made up of twenty four 24 children (12 boys and 12 girls). 
•	The first group watched a male or female model behaving aggressively towards a toy called a 'Bobo doll’.  
The adults attacked the Bobo doll in a distinctive manner - they used a hammer in some cases, and in others threw the doll in the air and shouted at it.  
•	The other group was exposed to a non-aggressive model who played in a quiet and subdued manner for 10 minutes (playing with a tinker toy set and ignoring the bobo-doll). 
•	Children who observed the aggressive model made far more imitative aggressive responses than those who were in the non-aggressive or control groups. 
•	Bobo doll experiment demonstrated that children are able to learn social behavior such as aggression through the process of observation learning, through watching the behavior of another person. 
Social Learning Theory 
•	Individuals that are observed are called models.  
•	In society, children are surrounded by many influential models, such as parents within the family, characters on children’s TV, friends within their peer group and teachers at school.  
•	These models provide examples of behavior to observe and imitate, e.g., masculine and feminine, pro and anti-social, etc. 
Principles of Social Learning 
•	From his research Bandura formulated four principles of social learning. 
•	Attention: We cannot learn if we are not focused on the task. If we see something as being novel or different in some way, we are more likely to make it the focus of their attention. 
•	Retention: We learn by internalizing information in our memories. We recall that information later when we are required to respond to a situation that is similar the situation within which we first learned the information. 
•	Reproduction: We reproduce previously learned information (behavior, skills, knowledge) when required. However, practice through mental and physical rehearsal often improves our responses. 
•	Motivation: We need to be motivated to do anything. Often that motivation originates from our observation of someone else being rewarded or punished for something they have done or said. This usually motivates us later to do, or avoid doing, the same thing. 
Vicarious Learning 
•	Vicarious learning is a way of learning that allows individuals to learn from the experience of others. It involves sensing, feeling, and empathizing with what people are doing and taking notes, and evaluating. 
•	Rather than direct, hands-on instructions, vicarious learning is derived from indirect sources such as hearing and seeing. 
•	Examples of indirect sources include: when an individual sees or hears a live situation, watches a video, listens to a story, reads a book, or imagines a situation. 
Educational Implications 
•	Teachers are able to apply classical conditioning in the class by creating a positive classroom environment to help students overcome anxiety or fear.  
Pairing an anxiety-provoking situation, such as performing in front of a group, with pleasant surroundings helps the student learn new associations 
Using operant conditioning can give students immediate feedback about their behavior.  
•	When the teacher rewards positive behavior, other students are more likely to copy that behavior to earn the reward. The rewarded student is also more likely to repeat that behavior because of the positive feedback. 
•	Teachers can use the principles of social learning and modelling to demonstrate to learner's classroom appropriate behaviours.  
•	Students SHOULD be involved in using their prior experiences and structures to learn new knowledge. 
•	Teachers should assist learners in building their knowledge. This assistance should fade away as it becomes unnecessary

PLAY 
•	Play is universal among children in all cultures and remains essential in child development (Berger, 2016). 
•	It is the most productive as well as the most enjoyable activity that children undertake (Elkind, 2007; Bateson & Martin, 2013; Smith, 2010). 
•	Play enhances learning in children and aids in social and cognitive development (Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development, 2018). 
  
•	According to Berger (2016), there are two types of play 
•	Pretend play: It often occurs when a child is alone 
 
Social play: This occurs with playmates (other children that the child plays with.  
•	Young children play best with peers or playmates, that is, people of about the same age and social status. 
•	Mildred Parten, an American sociologist described the five stages of social play, each more advanced than the previous one: 
  
STAGES OF SOCIAL PLAY 
. Solitary play: A child plays alone, unaware of any other children playing nearby. 
2.	Onlooker play: A child watches other children play. 
3.	Parallel play: Children play with similar objects in similar ways but not together. 
4.	Associative play: Children interact, sharing material, but their play is not reciprocal. 
5.	Cooperative play: Children play together, creating dramas or taking turns. 
  
ACTIVE PLAY 
•	It is a form of social play in which children use physical activity to develop muscle strength and control. 
•	Peers provide an audience, role models, and sometimes competition. For instance, running skills develop best when children chase or race each other, not when a child runs alone.  
•	Active social play correlates with peer acceptance and a healthy self-concept and may help regulate emotions (Becker et al., 2014; Sutton-Smith, 2011). Adults need to remember this when they want children to sit still and be quiet. 
TYPES OF ACTIVE PLAY 
•	Rough-and-tumble Play: Play that seems to be rough, as in play wrestling or chasing, but in which there is no intent to harm. 
•	Sociodramatic Play: Pretend play in which children act out various roles and themes in plots or roles that they create. 
SOCIODRAMATIC PLAY 
	• 	Sociodramatic play allow children to 
a.	Explore and rehearse social roles 
b.	Learn to explain their ideas and persuade playmates 
c.	Practice emotional regulation by pretending to be afraid, angry, brave, and so on 
d.	Develop self-concept in a non-threatening context 
THEORIES OF PLAY 
	• 	Surplus Energy Theory Schiller (1873) & Spencer (1875)  
•	They assert that play is the outcome of surplus energy that exists because the young are freed from the business of self- preservation through the activities of their parents. 
•	Spencer for instance saw play as the way in which animals and humans discharged excess energy through physical activity  
•	Energy finds its release in the aimless exuberant activities of play.  
	• 	Relaxation Theory Lazarus (1883)  & Patrick (1916) 
•	Play is seen as a mode of releasing the inhibitions built up from fatigue due to tasks that are relatively new to the individual. 
•	Relaxation theorists believe that play is a mode of relaxation or a de-stressor which restores all the energy that has been lost in the day to day work related activities.  
•	Play is simply a means of relaxation. 
	• 	 Recreation Theory - Moritz Lazarus (1883) 
•	Similar to the relaxation theory, proponents believe that play is means of recovering from fatigue experienced from hard work. 
•	The theory describes play as an activity originating from an energy deficit, and states that the purpose of play is to restore energy expended in work. 
•	Play restores energy and provides more benefit to the body than idleness. 
	• 	Recapitulation Theory - G’Stanley Hall (1906) 
•	Play serves to rid of an individual’s primitive and unnecessary instinctual skills carried over by hereditary.  
•	Hall believed that play is a cathartic or therapeutic or healing activity that removes inappropriate primitive instincts that were passed down through heredity. 
	• 	 Pre-Exercise Theory - Groos (1898)  
•	Play is the necessary rehearsal for behaviors that are needed for later survival.  
•	The rough and tumble play of children are basically the practice of skills that will later aid their survival. 
•	Play is very important to practice behaviours that will help children to survive when they grow into adults • 	Growth Theories - Appleton (1919) 
•	Play is a response to a universal drive for growth in individuals. It facilitates the mastery of skills necessary to function in later life or engage in adult behavior. 
•	Play does not only promote normal child development, but also helps them deal with experiences within the environment. 
Ego-Expanding Theories   Lange (1902), Claparde (1911) 
•	Play is nature's way of completing the ego or the self or a way expressing oneself and the rest of the personality. 
•	This exercise helps develops cognitive skills and aids in the emergence of additional skills. 
PLAY-BASED LEARNING 
•	Play-based learning is a pedagogical approach that emphasizes the use of play in promoting multiple areas of children’s development and learning. It impacts the development of children’s social and cognitive abilities, and academic skills (Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development, 2018). 
•	There are two main types of play-based learning approaches namely: 
•	Free Play 
•	Guided Play 
FREE PLAY APPROACH 
•	This types of play is child-directed and internally motivated. 
•	Free play is unstructured, informal, child-initiated practice that enables children to cultivate their imaginations while discovering and observing the world around them.  
•	It is spontaneous play that comes spontaneously from children's innate curiosity, enjoyment of adventure, and excitement. 
GUIDED PLAY APPROACH 
•	This type of play is supported by adults and geared at a specific learning goal or objective. 
•	Directed play is a type of play in which children experience the world that has been planned by adults and/or with guidance from adults.   
•	On the floor, supervised play always seems like free play, but it can be impossible to tell them apart just by seeing what kids are doing. 
PLAY-BASED VRS. ACADEMIC-BASED LEARNING 
•	Play-based learning helps a child develop holistically (social-emotional learning, developing confidence, motivation and practicing cognitive skills). 
•	Academic learning to early childhood education is more focused on teaching young children cognitive skills and knowledge (structured and routine). 
  
PLAY-BASED LEARNING ACTIVITIES 
•	Stories 
•	Games 
•	Poems 
•	Songs 
•	Role Play 
•	Lesson starters and energizers. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING PLAY-BASED LEARNING 
1.  The Physical Environment Factor 
•	This refers to the playing environment e.g. classroom arrangement or outdoor space management.  
•	The way the physical environment is designed and configured influences how children feel, act, and behave. 
•	The physical environment allows growth and development through activities and materials in defined play areas.  
•	The play area of learners needs to be configured so that they can grasp and reach age-appropriate toys or pull themselves up when practicing standing or walking.  
•	To maximize infant supervision, it is best to have all the activities in one room.  
•	The play areas are subdivided into dramatic, block, art, library, manipulative, and science learning centers. 
•	Young learners need spaces that allow them to experiment, explore, and discover things around their environment. 
•	In structuring the physical environment for play, consider these questions: How is the space arranged, both indoors and outdoors? 
•	Are there clearly marked areas in which children may find the play materials? Is there enough space between the areas to walk around?  
•	All of these features of a classroom will foster children’s freedom to choose their own activities, which in turn develops the complexity of their play as well as encourages ongoing play.  
Research has indicated that the way the classroom is arranged and the way it looks are significant influence children’s behaviour. 
•	Therefore, when setting up the classroom, teachers should consider the following suggestions: 
•	Have as much natural light in the classroom as possible. Natural light reduces energy use but, most important, enhances task performance and improves the appearance of an area. 
•	Keep noisy and quiet areas separate. Noisy areas such as dramatic play and music should be located at one end of the room, opposite to the quiet area. This will allow each area to have its activities in a comfortable location. 
      2. The Facilitator/Teacher Factor 
•	The teacher is the one the plan and coordinates play based activities. When planning play-based learning, teachers should consider the following: 
•	Determine developmental goals and objectives. 
•	Know principles of learning and children’s learning styles. 
•	Design and set up learning centers. 
•	Evaluate the learning environment. 
•	Teacher’s Attitudes: The attitude of the teacher towards play can either inhibit or promote efforts to effectively use play activities as a tool for instruction in the learning settings. 
•	The teacher must be passionate and realize that learning improves through self-exploration.  
•	Teacher’s experience 
•	Teacher’s Training 
EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
•	Physical development: Children learn how to control small muscles and how to coordinate eyes and hands to stack and balance when working with objects 
•	Cognitive development: Children learn and develop mathematical concepts by sorting the according to size and shape and figuring out what number of blocks are needed to fill a space.  
•	Development of imagination, creativity, and problem solving skills  
•	Social and Emotional Development: Children’s self-directed activity will help children enjoy learning and experience success—all of which build confidence, satisfaction, and the motivation to learn. 
•	It helps children achieve mastery in certain skills, and they learn to have control over their environment.  
•	Play opportunities promotes learning of various physical skills, development of self-confidence, independence, social competence, language development and emotional development. 
 
 
WEEK 10 – FACTORS AFFECTING LEARNING (MEMORY) 
•	Explaining Memory 
 
Processes of Memory – Encoding, Storage, Retrieval 
•	Memory Categories- Sensory Memory, Short and Long Term Memory 
•	Improving Memory 
•	Forgetting 
•	Theories of Forgetting 
•	Techniques for Minimizing Forgetting  
•	Educational Implications 
Memory 
•	Memory refers to the processes that are used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. 
•	It is the ability to take in information, store it, and recall it at a later time. 
•	So, memory can simply be defined as the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future actions (use). Processes of Memory 
•	Encoding: It is when information is allowed into the memory system automatically or by personalized effort. Encoding puts new (incoming) information into the information processing system and preparing it for storage in long term memory (LTM).  
•	Storage: It is when information encoded is processed and maintained for future use. It is often called retention. 
•	Retrieval: It is when stored or retained information is brought to bear for use by an individual. This is about recalling the stored information for use or application in a desired circumstance. 
  
Categories of Memory 
•	Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) proposed three categories of memory namely; 
•	The sensory memory OR sensory register 
•	The short-term memory OR working memory 
 The long-term memory.  
  
The Sensory Register 
•	The sensory register is the memory store where information first comes in through the senses. There are separate sensory registers for each of the five senses.  
•	Iconic memory is the one responsible for visual information that is received by the memory system. 
•	Echoic memory is the one responsible for auditory information received by the memory system.  
•	Haptic memory is the one responsible for movement-based information that is received by the memory system. 
•	Olfactory memory: This codes for smell based information that is being received by the sensory memory 
•	Gustatory memory: This codes for taste based information. E.g. You are able to code whether a certain type of food tastes sour, bitter, sweet etc.  
  
The Sensory Register 
•	The sensory register has a time-span of just five (5) seconds. It does not keep information beyond the limit else it will be lost.  
•	The sensory register therefore has a limited capacity in terms of time but limitless in terms of sensory information 
Short-Term Memory 
•	Short-term memory is also known as working memory. It holds only a few items (research shows a range of 7 +/- 2 items) and only lasts for about 20 seconds.  
•	However, items can be moved from short-term memory to long-term memory via processes like rehearsal.  
•	An example of rehearsal is when someone gives you a phone number verbally and you say it to yourself repeatedly until you can write it down.  
If someone interrupts your rehearsal by asking a question, you can easily forget the number, since it is only being held in your short-term memory. 
Long-Term Memory 
•	Long-term memories are all the memories we hold for periods of time longer than a few seconds. 
•	It encompasses everything from what we learned in first grade to our old addresses to what we wore to work yesterday. 
•	Long-term memory has an incredibly vast storage capacity, and some memories can last from the time they are created until we die. 
•	There are two major types of long-term memory: Explicit memory and Implicit Memory.  
Explicit Memory 
•	This category of LTM is made of conscious or effortful memory of situations or events. In this, the individual is aware of the situation and make a conscious effort to remember it or recall it.  
•	Explicit memory is sub-divided into episodic and semantic (declarative memory). 
•	Episodic Memory is about recalling autobiographic facts or information. E.g. The issue of the 2012 and 2020 election petition in Ghana.  
•	Semantic Memory is about recalling something because you have learned but not necessarily experienced it personally E.g. the 1983 famine or hunger that occurred in Ghana.  
Implicit Memory 
•	This is made of unconscious and effortless ability to recall a situation or an event because it has been a routine thing that you do.  
•	It is about a skill or an experience that influences a person’s behaviour.  
•	Implicit memory is subdivided into procedural memory and priming memory. 
•	Procedural Memory: Memory of a learned skill or ability becomes part and parcel of the person, where this skill or ability is exhibited without thinking about it. Such skill or ability is exhibited automatically.  E.g. The skill of riding, and driving. 
•	Priming Memory: It allows one stimulus to influences how people respond to subsequent stimuli. It is when experience influences behaviour. After seeing the word doctor, it will be faster to recognize the word nurse an unrelated word (like cat) because the medical concepts are closely associated in her mind. 
Improving Memory 
•	Identifying or generating linkage between the new and old materials already retained in organized fashion 
•	Developing images to supplement semantic form of the content 
•	Thinking about the implications of applications of the material  
•	Answering questions and holding discussion about the material.  
Forgetting 
•	Forgetting refers to the loss of information from memory or to the inability to access information or the loss of information over time. 
Forgetting represents inaccessibility of information due to improper retrieval cues.  
•	Information in memory does not decay, become confused, or get lost. Rather, the memory trace is intact but cannot be accessed.  
•	Memory of information depends on the trace being intact and on having adequate retrieval cues. 
Theories of Forgetting 
	• 	 
	• 	Theory of Disuse 
•	This theory holds that forgetting takes place when there is no practice.   
•	Thorndike (1913) emphasized that when practice is discontinued after establishing a bond between a stimulus and response, the connection gets weakened resulting in forgetting 
Theory of Decay  
•	This theory holds that any material put into the Short-Term Memory (STM) establishes a trace.   
•	This trace decays simply as a function of time since the material was last attended to and it is revealed by the decreased availability of the item for recall as time passes. 
Interference Theory 
•	Interference is said to have taken place when something learned before or something learned after an event hinders the memory of that event.  
•	Thus, two basic paradigms of interference theory known as retroactive and proactive inhibitions are distinguished. 
Types of Interference 
•	Proactive interference or inhibition occurs when old learning experiences blocks learning of a new learning experience. Thus, one cannot learn a new task because of a previously learnt task.  
•	Retroactive interference or inhibition occurs when new learning experiences block the memory of old learning experience. In other words previously learnt task are forgotten because of new learning task. 
Other Causes of Forgetting 
•	Amnesia: Amnesia is the sudden memory loss is more commonly referred to as amnesia. The primary symptom of amnesia is memory loss or inability to form new memories.  
•	Amnesia is caused by head injury, stress, excessive alcohol usage, anoxia (reduced levels of oxygen in the brain), and age (dementia).  
•	There two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia.  
Types of Amnesia 
•	Retrograde amnesia (RA) refers to the loss of information that was acquired before the onset of amnesia. When you have retrograde amnesia, you lose existing, previously made memories.  
•	This type of amnesia tends to affect recently formed memories first. Older memories, such as memories from childhood, are usually affected more slowly.  
Anterograde amnesia (AA) refers to an impaired capacity for new learning. When you have anterograde amnesia, you cannot form new memories. This effect can be temporary. It can also be permanent.  Other Factors Influencing Forgetting 
•	Other reasons for forgetting are: 
•	Retrieval failure 
•	Ineffective encoding 
•	Motivated forgetting 
•	Organic causes 
Techniques for Minimizing Forgetting 
•	Attention: Attention is a necessary prerequisite of learning and minimizing forgetting. To minimize forgetting, students must attend to the teacher’s voice and ignore other sounds. Attention is a limited resource; learners do not have unlimited amounts of it. 
•	Organization: It is accepted that forgetting can be minimized when learned material is properly organized. It alleged that that well-organized material is easier to learn and recall. 
•	Memory is enhanced by classifying and grouping bits of information into organized chunks. Organized material improves memory because items are linked to one another systematically.  
•	Rehearsal: Rehearsing information keeps it in memory and reduces forgetting. Rehearsal has two components: maintenance rehearsal (repeating information over and over) and elaborative rehearsal (relating the information to something already known). 
•	In maintenance rehearsal where we repeat information for immediate use of the STM while in elaborate rehearsal which involves repetition of material for use in the LTM. 
Educational Implications 
•	Attention is essential for students to keep good memory of what they have studied. Teachers need to creatively sustain student’s attention in class. 
•	This can be done by providing frequent breaks from task requiring considerable attention and concentration 
•	Other effective strategies the attention of students are putting variety in topics and using different presentation styles  
•	Allow students to ask questions 
•	Try to minimize distractions when independent work is assigned to help sustain attention. 
•	Monitor students’ behaviors 
•	Learners can process only a limited amount of information at a time. Therefore, lessons should not be overloaded. 
•	Learners differ in their ability to control what they attend and consciously think about.
